Feel free to email, or call me.\r\n\r\nIf there is a specific property you have a question about, please send me the address or MLS# of the home and I will schedule an appointment for you.\r\nIf you are looking for a great agent to list your home, please provide me with your address and contact information and I will be back in touch with you immediately.\r\n\r\n   My clients have found me to be a useful asset when dealing with all aspects of a real estate transaction. I believe in earning a   client's trust by demonstrating an ability to listen to what is important to them, in their search for a new home\r\n  \r\n    I believe if you provide a service that is better than the majority of your competition, your clients will refer business to you as a result of exceeding their expectations. I like the challenge of finding the perfect home for a new client. The word that best describes how I approach a real estate transaction is \"patience.\" I am not in a hurry, unless the client is. Sometimes you find a home the first day out, sometimes it takes 3 to 5 months. Do what is best for the client!\r\nSearch listings for homes, condos or vacant land in Bellevue，Clyde Hill, Enatai, Kirkland, Seattle Washington, please click the link below.\r\n\r\n[Search House](http://www.skylineproperties.com/fenglingcheng)\r\n\r\n![Skyline Properties Inc](realty.github.io/SkylineLogo_wide_white.png)",
